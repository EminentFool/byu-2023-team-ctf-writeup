lego_faces was a rather difficult challenge for me to solve. The challenge provided us with a text file called lego_faces.txt, which you can find here as well. Upon opening the file, you can see that it's basically a bunch of garbage text meaning nothing. It looked pretty similar to opening an image in a text editor, so I looked at the formatting to find out which kind of image it was. It looked like a png file, execpt it didn't say PNG at the top of the file like a normal png does. I added the letters at the top there and saved it as lego_faces.png, but it didn't work. I opened it up in a hex editor and found that the image header--IHDR--was not where it was supposed to be. I then found an explanation of what the hex of a tpical png looks like, attached as png-header-info.png, and found that the first half of the png signature had been removed. I inserted it according to the explanation, saved it as a png, and it worked. The final image was all jumble up, as can be seen in lego_faces.png, and it was just a matter of editing the picture to line up all the words. The final flag came out to be byu23team{minis}.
